## 🛠️ **About Me**
I’m a dedicated Software Engineer and a recent graduate of the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, where I honed my skills in full-stack development and systems engineering. I’m driven by a passion for solving real-world problems and pushing the boundaries of technology through continuous learning and exploration.

Back-end development, automation, and scalable systems are my main focus, but I also have a solid foundation in front-end work, allowing me to deliver versatile, end-to-end solutions. I enjoy tackling complex challenges, building meaningful applications, and contributing to open-source communities.

## 🌱 **Currently Learning**
I am currently diving deeper into back-end technologies and DevOps practices to strengthen my skill set:

- **RabbitMQ** for message brokering and handling real-time data.
- **ELK Stack** for monitoring and log analysis, making scalable systems even more robust.
- **PyTorch** for AI and machine learning to expand my capabilities into intelligent features.
